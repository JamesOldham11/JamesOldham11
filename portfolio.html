                At the "boom and bust" talk, it was argued speculation metaphorically created the "heat" of a bubble,
                especially recently with the assistance of media/internet.

                I used the monthly google search data for "bitcoin" to show the correlation between search frequency and
                bubbles/crashes of bitcoin prices.

            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>
              My hypothesis was that developing (low GDP) countries would generate a greater proportion of their electricity using fossil fuels. 
              For fear of word limit; very aware of OVB etc in the regression.
              Rsq of 0.12 shows a weak correlation between GDP per capita and % of electricty generated from fossil fuels.

            <p>Screenshot of Colab graph before restricting domain (Rsq=0.0018). I did this due to the skew from countries such as Qatar ("exceptional" access to fossil fuels, very high GDP)</p>

            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>
              I used daily average (Farenheit) temperatures from 1950 to 2022 at Heathrow on the hypothesis that, with global warming, we would see years chronoligcally close to each other being clustered together.

            <p>
                The results aren't surprising, with only three years since 2000 in the right two clusters that seem to correspond to cooler year clusters. I was surprised that none of the five hottest years were directly grouped together, which goes to show they must have had varying warmer periods during their respective years.
